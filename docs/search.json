This should include, but is not limited to, a maternal health and anesthetic history, a relevant obstetric history, a baseline blood pressure measurement, and an airway, heart, and lung examination, consistent with the ASA “Practice Advisory for Preanesthesia Evaluation.”\n\n\n    When a neuraxial anesthetic is planned or placed, examine the patient’s back.\n\n\n    Recognition of significant anesthetic or obstetric risk factors should encourage consultation between the obstetrician and the anesthesiologist.\n\n\n    A communication system should be in place to encourage early and ongoing contact between obstetric providers, anesthesiologists, and other members of the multidisciplinary team.\n\n\n    The anesthesiologist’s decision to order or require a platelet count should be individualized and based on a patient’s history (e.g., preeclampsia), physical examination and clinical signs.\n\n\n    A routine platelet count is not necessary in the healthy parturient.\n\n\n    A routine blood cross-match is not necessary for healthy and uncomplicated parturients for vaginal or operative delivery.\n\n\n    The decision whether to order or require a blood type and screen or cross-match should be based on maternal history, anticipated hemorrhagic complications (e.g., placenta accreta in a patient with placenta previa and previous uterine surgery), and local institutional policies.\n\n\n    Fetal heart rate patterns should be monitored by a qualified individual before and after administration of neuraxial analgesia for labor.\n\n\n    Continuous electronic recording of fetal heart rate patterns may not be necessary in every clinical setting and may not be possible during initiation of neuraxial anesthesia.\n\n\n    \n      Aspiration Prevention\n    \n    The oral intake of moderate amounts of clear liquids may be allowed for uncomplicated laboring patients.\n\n\n    The uncomplicated patient undergoing elective surgery may have moderate amounts of clear liquids up to 2 h before induction of anesthesia. (Examples of clear liquids include, but are not limited to, water, fruit juices without pulp, carbonated beverages, clear tea, black coffee, and sports drinks.)\n\n\n    The volume of liquid ingested is less important than the presence of particulate matter in the liquid ingested.\n\n\n    Laboring patients with additional risk factors for aspiration (e.g., morbid obesity, diabetes, difficult airway), or patients at increased risk for operative delivery (e.g., nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern) may have further restrictions of oral intake, determined on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n    Solid foods should be avoided in laboring patients.\n\n\n    The patient undergoing elective surgery (e.g., scheduled cesarean delivery or postpartum tubal ligation) should undergo a fasting period for solids of 6 to 8 hours depending on the type of food ingested (e.g., fat content)\n\n\n    Adherence to a predetermined fasting period before non-elective surgical procedures may not always be possible due to the uncertain timing of delivery for laboring patients.\n\n\n    Before surgical procedures (e.g., cesarean delivery, postpartum tubal ligation), consider the timely administration of non-particulate antacids, H2 receptor antagonists, and/or metoclopramide for aspiration prophylaxis.\n\n\n    \n      Anesthetic Care for Labor and Delivery\n    \n    Provide patients in early labor (i.e., &lt; 5 cm dilation) the option of neuraxial analgesia when this service is available.\n\n\n    Offer neuraxial analgesia on an individualized basis regardless of cervical dilation. (Reassure patients that the use of neuraxial analgesia does not increase the incidence of cesarean delivery.)\n\n\n    Offer neuraxial techniques to patients attempting vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery.\n\n\n    For these patients, consider early placement of a neuraxial catheter that can be used later for labor analgesia, or for anesthesia in the event of operative delivery.\n\n\n    Consider early insertion of a neuraxial catheter for obstetric (e.g., twin gestation or preeclampsia) or anesthetic indications (e.g., anticipated difficult airway or obesity) to reduce the need for general anesthesia if an emergent procedure becomes necessary.\n\n\n    In these cases, the insertion of a neuraxial catheter may precede the onset of labor or a patient’s request for labor analgesia.\n\n\n    Continuous epidural infusion may be used for effective analgesia for labor and delivery.\n\n\n    When a continuous epidural infusion of local anesthetic is selected, an opioid may be added to reduce the concentration of local anesthetic, improve the quality of analgesia, and minimize motor block.\n\n\n    Use dilute concentrations of local anesthetics with opioids to produce as little motor block as possible.\n\n\n    Single-injection spinal opioids with or without local anesthetics may be used to provide effective, although time-limited, analgesia for labor when spontaneous vaginal delivery is anticipated.\n\n\n    If labor duration is anticipated to be longer than the analgesic effects of the single-injection spinal drugs chosen, or if there is a reasonable possibility of operative delivery, then consider a catheter technique instead of a single injection technique.\n\n\n    A local anesthetic may be added to a single-injection spinal opioid to increase duration and improve quality of analgesia.\n\n\n    Use pencil-point spinal needles instead of cutting-bevel spinal needles to minimize the risk of postdural puncture headache.\n\n\n    If labor duration is anticipated to be longer than the analgesic effects of the spinal drugs chosen, or if there is a reasonable possibility of operative delivery, then consider a catheter technique instead of a single injection technique.\n\n\n    Combined spinal-epidural techniques may be used to provide effective and rapid onset of analgesia for labor.\n\n\n    PCEA may be used to provide an effective and flexible approach for the maintenance of labor analgesia.\n\n\n    The use of PCEA may be preferable to fixed-rate CIE for administering reduced dosages of local anesthetics.\n\n\n    PCEA may be used with or without a background infusion.\n\n\n    \n      Removal of Retained Placenta\n    \n    In general, there is no preferred anesthetic technique for removal of retained placenta. If an epidural catheter is in place and the patient is hemodynamically stable, consider providing epidural anesthesia.\n\n\n    Assess hemodynamic status before administering neuraxial anesthesia.\n\n\n    Consider aspiration prophylaxis.\n\n\n    Titrate sedation/analgesia carefully due to the potential risks of respiratory depression and pulmonary aspiration during the immediate postpartum period.\n\n\n    In cases involving major maternal hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability, general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube may be considered in preference to neuraxial anesthesia.\n\n\n    Nitroglycerin may be used as an alternative to terbutaline sulfate or general endotracheal anesthesia with halogenated agents for uterine relaxation during removal of retained placental tissue.\n\n\n    Initiating treatment with incremental doses of intravenous or sublingual (i.e., tablet or metered dose spray) nitroglycerin may be done to sufficiently relax the uterus.\n\n\n    \n      Anesthetic Care for Cesarean Delivery\n    \n    Equipment, facilities, and support personnel available in the labor and delivery operating suite should be comparable to those available in the main operating suite.\n\n\n    Resources for the treatment of potential complications (e.g., failed intubation, inadequate analgesia, hypotension, respiratory depression, pruritus, vomiting) should also be available in the labor and delivery operating suite.\n\n\n    Appropriate equipment and personnel should be available to care for obstetric patients recovering from neuraxial or general anesthesia.\n\n\n    The decision to use a particular anesthetic technique for cesarean delivery should be individualized, based on anesthetic, obstetric or fetal risk factors (e.g., elective vs. emergency), the preferences of the patient, and the judgment of the anesthesiologist.\n\n\n    Uterine displacement (usually left displacement) should be maintained until delivery regardless of the anesthetic technique used.\n\n\n    Consider selecting neuraxial techniques in preference to general anesthesia for most cesarean deliveries.\n\n\n    If spinal anesthesia is chosen, use pencil-point spinal needles instead of cutting-bevel spinal needles.\n\n\n    For urgent cesarean delivery, an indwelling epidural catheter may be used as an alternative to initiation of spinal or general anesthesia.\n\n\n    General anesthesia may be the most appropriate choice in some circumstances (e.g., profound fetal bradycardia, ruptured uterus, severe hemorrhage, severe placental abruption).\n\n\n    Intravenous fluid preloading or co-loading may be used to reduce the frequency of maternal hypotension following spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery.\n\n\n    Do not delay the initiation of spinal anesthesia in order to administer a fixed volume of intravenous fluid.\n\n\n    Either intravenous ephedrine or phenylephrine may be used for treating hypotension during neuraxial anesthesia.\n\n\n    In the absence of maternal bradycardia, consider selecting phenylephrine because of improved fetal acid-base status in uncomplicated pregnancies.\n\n\n    For postoperative analgesia after neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery, consider selecting neuraxial opioids rather than intermittent injections of parenteral opioids.\n\n\n    \n      Postpartum Tubal Ligation\n    \n    Before a postpartum tubal ligation, the patient should have no oral intake of solid foods within 6 - 8 h of the surgery, depending on the type of food ingested (e.g., fat content). Consider aspiration prophylaxis.\n\n\n    Both the timing of the procedure and the decision to use a particular anesthetic technique (i.e., neuraxial vs. general) should be individualized, based on anesthetic and obstetric risk factors (e.g., blood loss), and patient preferences.\n\n\n    Consider selecting neuraxial techniques in preference to general anesthesia for most postpartum tubal ligations.\n\n\n    Be aware that gastric emptying will be delayed in patients who have received opioids during labor.\n\n\n    Be aware that an epidural catheter placed for labor may be more likely to fail with longer post-delivery time intervals.\n\n\n    If a postpartum tubal ligation is to be performed before the patient is discharged from the hospital, do not attempt the procedure at a time when it might compromise other aspects of patient care on the labor and delivery unit.\n\n\n    \n      Management of Obstetric and Anesthetic Emergencies\n    \n    Institutions providing obstetric care should have resources available to manage hemorrhagic emergencies.\n\n\n    In an emergency, type-specific or O negative blood is acceptable.\n\n\n    In cases of intractable hemorrhage when banked blood is not available or the patient refuses banked blood, consider intraoperative cell-salvage if available.\n\n\n    Labor and delivery units should have personnel and equipment readily available to manage airway emergencies consistent with the ASA Practice Guidelines for Management of the Difficult Airway, to include a pulse oximeter and carbon dioxide detector.\n\n\n    Basic airway management equipment should be immediately available during the provision of neuraxial analgesia.\n\n\n    Portable equipment for difficult airway management should be readily available in the operative area of labor and delivery units.\n\n\n    A preformulated strategy for intubation of the difficult airway should be in place.\n\n\n    When tracheal intubation has failed, consider ventilation with mask and cricoid pressure, or with a supraglottic airway device (e.g., laryngeal mask airway, intubating laryngeal mask airway, laryngeal tube) for maintaining an airway and ventilating the lungs.\n\n\n    If it is not possible to ventilate or awaken the patient, create an airway surgically.\n\n\n    Basic and advanced life-support equipment should be immediately available in the operative area of labor and delivery units.\n\n\n    If cardiac arrest occurs, initiate standard resuscitative measures.\n\n\n    Uterine displacement (usually left displacement) should be maintained.\n\n\n    If maternal circulation is not restored within 4 min, cesarean delivery should be performed by the obstetrics team\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n       — : Recommendation/explanatory without strength of evidence rating."

Statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) outcomes are designated as either beneficial (B) or harmful (H) for the patient; statistically nonsignificant findings are designated as equivocal (E). Level 1: The literature contains a sufficient number of RCTs to conduct meta-analysis, and meta-analytic findings from these aggregated studies are reported as evidence. Level 2: The literature contains multiple RCTs, but the number of RCTs is not sufficient to conduct a viable meta-analysis for the purpose of these updated guidelines.

Observational studies or RCTs without pertinent comparison groups may permit inference of beneficial or harmful relationships among clinical interventions and clinical outcomes. Inferred findings are given a directional designation of beneficial (B), harmful (H), or equivocal (E). For studies that report statistical findings, the threshold for significance is P &lt; 0.01. Level 1: The literature contains observational comparisons (e.g., cohort, case-control research designs) with comparative statistics between clinical interventions for a specified clinical outcome. Level 2: The literature contains noncomparative observational studies with associative statistics (e.g., relative risk, correlation, sensitivity/specificity). Level 3: The literature contains noncomparative observational studies with descriptive statistics (e.g., frequencies, percentages). Level 4: The literature contains case reports.\nInsufficient Literature. The lack of sufficient scientific evidence in the literature may occur when the evidence is either unavailable (i.e., no pertinent studies found) or inadequate. Inadequate literature cannot be used to assess relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes because a clear interpretation of findings is not obtained due to methodological concerns (e.g., confounding of study design or implementation), or the study does not meet the criteria for content as defined in the “Focus” of the guidelines."

Static ultrasound may be used when the subclavian or femoral vein is selected.\n\n\n    Use real time ultrasound guidance for vessel localization and venipuncture when the internal jugular vein is selected for cannulation (see fig. 1). Real-time ultrasound may be used when the subclavian or femoral vein is selected. The Task Force recognizes that this approach may not be feasible in emergency circumstances or in the presence of other clinical constraints.\n\n\n    After insertion of a catheter that went over the needle or a thin-wall needle, confirm venous access. Methods for confirming that the catheter or thin-wall needle resides in the vein include, but are not limited to, ultrasound, manometry, pressure-waveform analysis, or venous blood gas measurement. Blood color or absence of pulsatile flow should not be relied upon for confirming that the catheter or thin-wall needle resides in the vein.\n\n\n    When using the thin-wall needle technique, confirm venous residence of the wire after the wire is threaded.\n\n\n    When using the catheter-over-the-needle technique, confirmation that the wire resides in the vein may not be needed (1) when the catheter enters the vein easily and manometry or pressure waveform measurement provides unambiguous confirmation of venous location of the catheter; and (2) when the wire passes through the catheter and enters the vein without difficulty.\n\n\n    If there is any uncertainty that the catheter or wire resides in the vein, confirm venous residence of the wire after the wire is threaded. Insertion of a dilator or large-bore catheter may then proceed.\n\n\n    Methods for confirming that the wire resides in the vein include, but are not limited to, ultrasound (identification of the wire in the vein) or transesophageal echocardiography (identification of the wire in the superior vena cava or right atrium), continuous electrocardiography (identification of narrow-complex ectopy), or fluoroscopy.\n\n\n    After final catheterization and before use, confirm residence of the catheter in the venous system as soon as clinically appropriate. Methods for confirming that the catheter is still in the venous system after catheterization and before use include manometry or pressure waveform measurement.\n\n\n    Confirm the final position of the catheter tip as soon as clinically appropriate. Methods for confirming the position of the catheter tip include chest radiography, fluoroscopy, or continuous electrocardiography. For central venous catheters placed in the operating room, perform the chest radiograph no later than the early postoperative period to confirm the position of the catheter tip.\n\n\n    When unintended cannulation of an arterial vessel with a dilator or large-bore catheter occurs, the dilator or catheter should be left in place and a general surgeon, a vascular surgeon, or an interventional radiologist should be immediately consulted regarding surgical or nonsurgical catheter removal for adults.\n\n\n    For neonates, infants, and children the decision to leave the catheter in place and obtain consultation or to remove the catheter non-surgically should be based on practitioner judgment and experience.\n\n\n    After the injury has been evaluated and a treatment plan has been executed, the anesthesiologist and surgeon should confer regarding relative risks and benefits of proceeding with the elective surgery versus deferring surgery to allow for a period of patient observation.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n       — : Recommendation/explanatory without strength of evidence rating."

Providing Perioperative Pain Management\n    \n    Anesthesiologists offering perioperative analgesia services should provide, in collaboration with other healthcare professionals as appropriate, ongoing education and training to ensure that hospital personnel are knowledgeable and skilled with regard to the effective and safe use of the available treatment options within the institution.\n◦   Educational content should range from basic bedside pain assessment to sophisticated pain management techniques (e.g., epidural analgesia, PCA, and various regional anesthesia techniques) and nonpharmacologic techniques (e.g., relaxation, imagery, hypnotic methods).\n◦ For optimal pain management, ongoing education and training are essential for new personnel, to maintain skills, and whenever therapeutic approaches are modified.\n\nB2\n    Anesthesiologists and other healthcare providers should use standardized, validated instruments to facilitate the regular evaluation and documentation of pain intensity, the effects of pain therapy, and side effects caused by the therapy.\n\n — \n    Anesthesiologists responsible for perioperative analgesia should be available at all times to consult with ward nurses, surgeons, or other involved physicians.\n\n — \n    [Anesthesiologists] should assist in evaluating patients who are experiencing problems with any aspect of perioperative pain relief.\n\nB2\n    Anesthesiologists providing perioperative analgesia services should do so within the framework of an Acute Pain Service.\n\nB2\n    [Anesthesiologists] should participate in developing standardized institutional policies and procedures.\n\n — \n    \n      Preoperative Evaluation of the Patient\n    \n    A directed pain history, a directed physical examination, and a pain control plan should be included in the anesthetic preoperative evaluation.\n\nD\n    \n      Preoperative Preparation of the Patient\n    \n    Patient preparation for perioperative pain management should include appropriate adjustments or continuation of medications to avert an abstinence syndrome, treatment of preexistent pain, or preoperative initiation of therapy for postoperative pain management.\n\nD\n    Anesthesiologists offering perioperative analgesia services should provide, in collaboration with others as appropriate, patient and family education regarding their important roles in achieving comfort, reporting pain, and in proper use of the recommended analgesic methods.\n\nC2\n    Common misconceptions that overestimate the risk of adverse effects and addiction should be dispelled.\n\n — \n    Patient education for optimal use of PCA and other sophisticated methods, such as patient-controlled epidural analgesia, might include discussion of these analgesic methods at the time of the preanesthetic evaluation, brochures and videotapes to educate patients about therapeutic options, and discussion at the bedside during postoperative visits.\n\n — \n    Such education may also include instruction in behavioral modalities for control of pain and anxiety.\n\n — \n    \n      Perioperative Techniques for Pain Management\n    \n    Anesthesiologists who manage perioperative pain should use therapeutic options such as epidural or intrathecal opioids, systemic opioid PCA, and regional techniques after thoughtfully considering the risks and benefits for the individual patient.\n\nA2\n    These modalities should be used in preference to intramuscular opioids ordered “as needed.”\n\n — \n    The therapy selected should reflect the individual anesthesiologist’s expertise, as well as the capacity for safe application of the modality in each practice setting.\n\n — \n    This capacity includes the ability to recognize and treat adverse effects that emerge after initiation of therapy.\n\n — \n    Special caution should be taken when continuous infusion modalities are used because drug accumulation may contribute to adverse events.\n\n — \n    \n      Multimodal Techniques for Pain Management\n    \n    Whenever possible, anesthesiologists should use multimodal pain management therapy.\n\nA1\n    Unless contraindicated, patients should receive an around-the-clock regimen of NSAIDs, COXIBs, or acetaminophen.\n\nC2\n    Regional blockade with local anesthetics should be considered.\n\n — \n    Dosing regimens should be administered to optimize efficacy while minimizing the risk of adverse events.\n\n — \n    The choice of medication, dose, route, and duration of therapy should be individualized.\n\n — \n    \n      Pediatric Patients\n    \n    Aggressive and proactive pain management is necessary to overcome the historic undertreatment of pain in children.\n\n — \n    Perioperative care for children undergoing painful procedures or surgery requires developmentally appropriate pain assessment and therapy.\n\n — \n    Analgesic therapy should depend upon age, weight, and comorbidity, and unless contraindicated should involve a multimodal approach.\n\n — \n    Behavioral techniques, especially important in addressing the emotional component of pain, should be applied whenever feasible.\n\n — \n    Sedative, analgesic, and local anesthetics are all important components of appropriate analgesic regimens for painful procedures.\n\n — \n    Because many analgesic medications are synergistic with sedating agents, it is imperative that appropriate monitoring be used during the procedure and recovery.\n\n — \n    \n      Geriatric Patients\n    \n    Pain assessment and therapy should be integrated into the perioperative care of geriatric patients.\n\n — \n    Pain assessment tools appropriate to a patient’s cognitive abilities should be used. Extensive and proactive evaluation and questioning may be necessary to overcome barriers that hinder communication regarding unrelieved pain.\n\n — \n    Anesthesiologists should recognize that geriatric patients may respond differently than younger patients to pain and analgesic medications, often because of comorbidity.\n\n — \n    Vigilant dose titration is necessary to ensure adequate treatment while avoiding adverse effects such as somnolence in this vulnerable group, who are often taking other medications (including alternative and complementary agents).\n\n — \n    \n      Other Patients\n    \n    Anesthesiologists should recognize that patients who are critically ill, cognitively impaired, or have communication difficulties may require additional interventions to ensure optimal perioperative pain management.\n\nD\n    Anesthesiologists should consider a therapeutic trial of an analgesic in patients with increased blood pressure and heart rate or agitated behavior when causes other than pain have been excluded.\n\nD\n  \n  \n  \n    \n       — : Recommendation/explanatory without strength of evidence rating."

    "text": "10.2 Evidence Rating Scheme\nCategory A: Supportive Literature Randomized controlled trials report statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) differences between clinical interventions for a specified clinical outcome. Level 1: The literature contains multiple, randomized controlled trials, and the aggregated findings are supported by meta-analysis. Level 2: The literature contains multiple, randomized controlled trials, but there is an insufficient number of studies to conduct a viable meta-analysis for the purpose of these Guidelines. Level 3: The literature contains a single randomized controlled trial.\nCategory B: Suggestive Literature Information from observational studies permits inference of beneficial or harmful relationships among clinical interventions and clinical outcomes. Level 1: The literature contains observational comparisons (e.g ., cohort and case–control research designs) of clinical interventions or conditions and indicates statistically significant differences between clinical interventions for a specified clinical outcome. Level 2: The literature contains noncomparative observational studies with associative (e.g., relative risk and correlation) or descriptive statistics. Level 3: The literature contains case reports.\nCategory C: Equivocal Literature The literature cannot determine whether there are beneficial or harmful relationships among clinical interventions and clinical outcomes. Level 1: Meta-analysis did not find significant differences among groups or conditions. Level 2: There is an insufficient number of studies to conduct meta-analysis and (1) randomized controlled trials have not found significant differences among groups or conditions or (2) randomized controlled trials report inconsistent findings. Level 3: Observational studies report inconsistent findings or do not permit inference of beneficial or harmful relationships.\nCategory D: Insufficient Evidence from Literature The lack of scientific evidence in the literature is described by the following conditions. (1) No identified studies address the specified relationships among interventions and outcomes. (2) The available literature cannot be used to assess relationships among clinical interventions and clinical outcomes. The literature either does not meet the criteria for content as defined in the “Focus” of the Guidelines or does not permit a clear interpretation of findings due to methodological concerns (e.g ., confounding in study design or implementation)."
