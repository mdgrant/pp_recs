## GRADE

**High** --- We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.

**Moderate** --- We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.

**Low** --- Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.

**Very Low** --- We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.
